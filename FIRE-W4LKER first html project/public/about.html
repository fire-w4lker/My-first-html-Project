<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a technology enthusiast based in Mozambique, currently taking my first steps into the vast world of software development. My journey began with a curiosity to understand how the applications we use daily work, and today I dedicate my time to learning the languages and tools that build the web. I am focused on absorbing every concept, from HTML structure to programming logic, with the goal of creating creative digital solutions.</p>

<p>I believe that the best way to learn is by getting my hands dirty, so I have been exploring various projects and tutorials to solidify my knowledge. Every error in the code has been an opportunity for growth, and every small project completed is a milestone in this new trajectory. I am building a solid foundation in modern technologies, always paying attention to clean code best practices and seeking to understand the tech ecosystem here in Maputo.</p>

<p>In this phase of discovery and intense study, my goal is to collaborate on challenging projects that allow me to apply what I am learning and exchange experiences with other code enthusiasts. I am excited about the possibilities that technology offers and motivated to constantly evolve in this career. If you are looking for someone dedicated, eager to learn, and ready to grow with the team, I look forward to connecting and contributing.</p>
